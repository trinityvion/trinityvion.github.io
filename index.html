<!-- This website is made completely of code that I stole from the internet. I started off by using some shitty automatic generator site, then I moved on to stealing more complex scripts.-->
<!-- If "my" code looks like an awkward mesh between different styles, that's why. This whole project took maybe 7 hours (tons of breaks included). Finding that fucking script alone took an hour, that shit was BURIED.-->
<!-- If you think you're better at coding then me, I do not care. In terms of raw usefullness, our society has a simple hierarchy: the better you are at coding, the closer to the bottom you are.-->
<!-- Note my careful use of the term "bottom": I mean it in two different ways. Indeed, coding is an activity EXCLUSIVELY for cocksucking femboys. To be any better at coding than I am you'd have to suck at least one cock. -->
<!-- Or at the very least you'd have to get handsy with a guy. If you unironically pride yourself on being able to code, then kill yourself, right now. Join the 40% already. You have no practical skills. No one will miss you. -->
<!-- Now you're probably wondering where I get off saying this having just made this shitty homepage. Indeed, I sacrificed my position at the top of the hierarchy to build this website. It's something I'm not proud of. -->
<!-- I mostly did it because, if I asked anyone else to do it for me, they'd be INSULTED, because all of my friends know the truth about programming and would be disgusted that I would associate them with filth. -->
<!-- So I took one for the team. But here's the thing: everything that I learned from this forsaken adventure, I will forget within a week. Then I'll be at the top again, and you'll be a loser for the rest of your life. -->
<!-- Having said all of this, if you don't like my website, feel free to make me a better one. Send your code to vion@tpng.team and include a video of you crying in a girly voice. If I like it enough, I may even keep your watermark.  -->
